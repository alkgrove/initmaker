Changes 2.0
Added version number to initmaker and starting with revision 2.0, anything prior was revision 1.0.

NVIC is no longer initialized inside of SystemInit rather a series of NVIC_ENABLE_<interrupt name> functions are provided that should be called when initializing if there is a handler available. 

Added more name aliases for interrupts. 

Added an environment variable, AWK to alias which awk on your system to use. For example, native awk on freebsd doesn't work and must use gawk. This can be changed within the scripts/initmaker.sh script. 

The uart.c and uart.h got complicated and were losing portability. I also introduced the same global badness that Linux has. These require the sercom you want to use as a UART console to be named CONSOLE_PORT. 

I2C master was redone to move the interrupt routines to i2cm.c and i2cm.h from the <cfg>_init.c file. the isr command file no longer is used. These require the sercom you want to use as a I2C master to be named I2CM_PORT. This no longer supports multiple I2C master SERCOMs.

SYSTICK now requires user to call SysTickInit() to configure systick. This requires the SysTick_Handler() to be added.

Fixed bug in TC Timer counter script for mode

Something with the more cygwin have messed with the path and AWKPATH now wants unix style even with cygwin. This gave an error about not finding 'functions.awk'. 

Added #define <NAME>_FREQUENCY to have an alias for timer/counter source frequency. Does not include prescaler.

Removed delay.c and delay.h and created tc.c. The delay functions are now defined in tc.c/tc.h. To use, add FEATURE_TIME_DELAY to the DEFS in makefile (ie -DFEATURE_TIME_DELAY). Include tc.c instead of delay.c. Redo the config with the latest code to get the TIMER_PORT_FREQUENCY define. Also added a time scheduler. This is a tickless virtual timer which calls a function after a period of timer. The timers are oneshot or retriggerable and can be cleared prior to timing out. This is enabled by compiling with tc.c and adding the global define in the makefile FEATURE_TIME_SCHEDULER.

Added peripherals to PA00 and PA01 that were missing. 

Changes 2.1
Block transfers added to sd.c
Added new category [DEFINES] to allow random #define <identifier> in init file
Add nvm.c and prototypes in nvnctrl.h for erase and writing of flash
Added tc.c to include delay and time scheduler. The time scheduler usese a single 32 bit counter to call an assigned function after a period of time. This can be continuous or one shot. 

Changes 2.2
Added API for Factory Signature or serial number
